As described in term.el, there are two mechanisms for directory
tracking, `term-command-hook' which works well by default, and
`term-handle-ansi-terminal-messages', which allows for greater
customization and features like remote directory tracking. These
2 mechanisms may sometimes conflict; this minor mode disables
`term-command-hook' to prevent it from overriding
`term-handle-ansi-terminal-messages'."
